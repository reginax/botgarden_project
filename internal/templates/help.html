    <h2>Searching</h2>

    <p>You can enter search criteria by typing into the text boxes or selecting
        an option from a pick list and then clicking one of the "Display:" options.
        Any combination of fields may be used.</p>

    <p>Some fields have an option of searching as either "keyword", "phrase", or "exact".</p>

    <p>
    <li><strong>Exact</strong>: This will only return records where the field value is <i>exactly</i> what
        you input (e.g. searching for locality <tt>Livermore Valley</tt> will only retrieve
        records where the locality is exactly <i>Livermore Valley</i>)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Phrase</strong>: Returned records will contain exactly what you input, but may have
        more text before or after it (e.g. searching <tt>Livermore Valley</tt> will also
        return <i>eastern Livermore Valley</i>, <i>4 mi west of Livermore Valley</i>, etc.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Keyword</strong>: This will return all records that contain all of the words
        entered in that field, in any order (e.g. searching <tt>Livermore Valley</tt> will
        also return <i>Arroyo Mocho Valley s of Livermore</i>, etc.)
    </li>
    </p>
    <h2>Displaying Search Results</h2>

    <p>If your search has one or more results, you'll see three panes presented -- Results, Facets, and Maps.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>There are three options for display.
    <li>List is ideal for seeing summaries of
        many records at once.
    </li>
    <li>Full shows the full details of each record, including
        images.
    </li>
    <li>Grid is ideal for viewing many specimens at once while also
        displaying images. Clicking the specimen ID number in any view will bring
        you to the Full view of that specimen. Clicking an image will open the full
        resolution image in a new tab.
    </li>
    </p>

    <h3>Facets</h3>

    <p>After performing a search, clicking the "Facets" tab will show you a list, in descending frequency order,
        of values which appear the records returned by your search. For
        example, if you search for Collector <tt>W. L. Jepson</tt> (exact), you will see
        under County <i>San Bernardino 1650</i>, <i>Solano 1385</i> etc., meaning there are
        1650 Jepson specimens collected in San Bernardino Co., 1385 specimens from Solano Co.
        etc. Clicking on the name of a facet will refine your search, returning
        only the results matching that value.</p>

    <h3>Maps</h3>

    <p>You may choose two different mapping options for your result set:
        <li>
    <p><strong>Berkeley Mapper</strong>: your results will be passed to Berkeley Mapper and plotted there.</li>
    <li><p><strong>Google Static Maps</strong>: up to 65 of your results will be plotted on the spot using Google Maps.
    </li>
    Note that only records which have LatLongs will be plotted!
    </p>
